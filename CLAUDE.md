# Wireframe v2.0 - Complete Session Summary

## Latest Session (2025-07-28)

### ‚úÖ All Tests Fixed!

Successfully fixed all remaining failing tests:

- **bot-commands.test.ts** - Fixed test isolation issues
- **service-container.test.ts** - Fixed DB access pattern (platform.env.DB ‚Üí env.DB)
- **cloud-platform-cache.test.ts** - Rewrote to work with real implementation
- **access.test.ts** - Added proper cleanup hooks

**Result**: All 318 tests now passing! üéâ

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Sentry Integration

Created comprehensive monitoring solution:

- **MonitoringPlugin** for EventBus - automatic event tracking
- Enhanced IMonitoringConnector interface with performance methods
- Added transaction and span support
- Automatic error detection and reporting
- Performance monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Data sanitization for sensitive information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Issues Discovered

- Test coverage command runs out of memory
- Need to refactor test configuration for better memory usage
- Added to high-priority TODO list

## Previous Session (2025-07-27)

### Test Helper Infrastructure

- Created comprehensive test helpers in `/src/__tests__/helpers/test-helpers.ts`
- Type-safe factories for test data
- Fixed D1Meta type issues
- Strict TypeScript compliance

### Fixed Major Test Files

- ‚úÖ access.test.ts, admin.test.ts, info.test.ts, debug.test.ts
- ‚úÖ requests.test.ts, start.test.ts, omnichannel tests
- ‚úÖ edge-cache tests, lazy-services tests, admin-panel tests
- ‚úÖ whatsapp-connector tests

### TypeScript Error Reduction

- Initial errors: 292
- Final: 0 errors in main code, all tests passing

## Current Status

### Achievements

- **318 tests passing** - 100% pass rate
- **Zero TypeScript errors** - Full strict mode compliance
- **Zero ESLint warnings** - Clean codebase
- **Sentry integration enhanced** - Automatic monitoring via EventBus
- **CI/CD fully operational** - All checks passing

### Known Issues

- Memory issues when running coverage reports
- Need to optimize test suite memory usage

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Fix memory issues in test suite** (HIGH)
2. **Refactor test configuration** to reduce memory usage (HIGH)
3. Implement user context tracking in commands
4. Add AI provider monitoring
5. Create Sentry dashboards

## Important Patterns Established

### Test Best Practices

- Global cleanup hooks via test-cleanup.ts
- Proper mock isolation
- No `any` types allowed
- Type guards for all optional values

### Monitoring Pattern

- EventBus plugin for automatic tracking
- Error events automatically captured
- Performance thresholds by operation type
- Sensitive data sanitization

## Key Files Updated

### Tests

- All test files now passing with proper types
- Global cleanup in grammy-mock.ts
- Comprehensive test helpers

### Monitoring

- `/src/plugins/monitoring-plugin.ts` - EventBus monitoring
- `/src/core/interfaces/monitoring.ts` - Enhanced interface
- Full test coverage for monitoring plugin

### Documentation

- CHANGELOG.md - Updated with all fixes
- PROJECT_STATE.md - Updated metrics
- TEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md - Comprehensive guide
- SENTRY_INTEGRATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md - Monitoring plan

## Commands to Verify

```bash
npm test              # All 318 tests pass
