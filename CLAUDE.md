## Project Workflow Guidelines

- Always check for the presence of a STRATEGIC_PLAN.md file in the project's docs directory. If it exists, follow its guidelines.
- Remember to consider Sentry and TypeScript strict mode
- Understand the core essence of the project by referring to documentation and best practices
- Backward compatibility is not required - always ask before implementing it
